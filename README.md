This is the repository for our 11.C85/6.C85 final project. The members of this team are Kristen A, Shreya B, Emilia C, and Marine G. Our team is developing an educational tool to inform the general public about the historical use of racially restrictive covenants and current economic and racial segregation in Middlesex County, MA. In this repo, there are the following folders - 

1. FP_1: This contains content for the project pitch.
2. FP_2: This contains the code and data needed to generate the prototype of one of our interactive visualizations. (To be described)
3. TBD
4. TBD

NOTE FOR TEAM - We should include content from our project plan/write-up in this read me at a later time. 

I am making notes in Kristen's branch to demo how branching works
